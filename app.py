st.write("""
**MedLab Sim** is a cutting-edge initiative focused on creating an AI-powered tool to streamline drug discovery. 
Our first goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates critical drug properties, starting with solubility, 
to help researchers save time and resources on early-stage experiments.

st.subheader("Why This Project Matters")
st.write("""
MedLab Sim accelerates the drug discovery process by simulating essential drug properties, allowing us to filter out 
less promising compounds quickly. Itâ€™s also a unique educational tool, giving students hands-on experience with 
AI applications in pharmacy and medicine, while building a strong foundation for further developments in the future.
