st.write("""
**MedLab Sim** is a project to create an AI tool that helps make drug discovery faster and easier. 
Our first goal is to develop a predictive model that estimates critical drug properties, to help researchers save time and resources on early-stage experiments.

st.subheader("Why This Project Matters")
st.write("""
MedLab speeds up drug discovery by simulating key drug properties, helping us quickly rule out less promising compounds.
Itâ€™s also a valuable learning tool, giving students practical experience with AI in pharmacy and medicine and setting a strong base for future growth.
